## 🎯 Business Problem

Vrinda Store wanted to understand:
- How sales and orders varied across months
- The impact of customer demographics (gender, age) on sales
- Which channels and states contributed the most
- How order statuses (delivered, returned, cancelled) affected business

---

## 📌 Dashboard Goals

The dashboard was designed to:
- Track monthly sales vs orders
- Compare men vs women sales contributions
- Show top performing states
- Analyze order status distribution
- Understand sales by channel (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.)
- Explore customer demographics (gender & age group)

---

## 📈 Key Visuals

- Orders vs Sales Trend → Tracks seasonality and growth
- Sales: Men vs Women → Women contribute 64% of total sales
- Order Status → 92% successful deliveries, 8% non-deliveries
- Top 5 States → Maharashtra leads with ₹2.99M in sales
- Orders by Channel → Amazon (35%) & Myntra (23%) dominate
- Gender vs Age → Majority buyers are adult women (34.6%)

---

## 💡 Insights

- Women are the primary customer base (64%) → marketing should target female shoppers
- Amazon & Myntra drive more than half of total orders → stronger partnerships needed
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are key states → potential for regional promotions
- Order cancellations & returns are below 10%, showing strong fulfillment performance
